## Simple interest

This is a reward that is accrued on the initial deposit amount for a certain period. Simple interest is not added to the body of the deposit and is paid either after the expiration of the contract, or once a month or year at the choice of the depositor. If the contract is extended for a new period, then the profit for the previous period is also not summed up with the deposit.

This accrual method is used, as a rule, for deposits with the possibility of replenishment and withdrawal of funds. The interest rate in this case is lower than with compound interest. This is explained by the fact that your contribution is a financial instrument for making a profit by the bank. And the less confidence that you will not take the money ahead of time, the lower the probability of long-term investment of capital by the bank, and hence the lower the income.

## Compound interest or capitalization

In this case, the income for the agreed period is added to the deposit amount. In the subsequent period, the remuneration is accrued on the increased amount of the deposit. The amount of the deposit gradually grows due to the accumulated interest, the final income becomes higher.

Capitalization term - the frequency with which the interest is added to the current body of the deposit. Banks add interest once a month, quarter or day. You may be offered a floating rate deposit where the interest increases over time. As a rule, the percentage increases with an increase in the period of storage of money on deposit, provided that there were no withdrawals.

The profitability of deposits with capitalization is higher due to an increase in the body of the loan, however, the deposit with limited movement of funds gives the greatest income: withdrawals and replenishments are prohibited, or additional deposits are allowed, but with a restriction. For example, the amount of all deposits cannot exceed the opening amount by more than 10 times.

## Calculation of simple interest

Having found out the annual rate, periods and types of interest accrual, you can calculate the income on the deposit.

Simple interest is calculated according to the following formula:

where:
S - interest paid,
P - initial investment amount,
I - annual rate,
T - number of deposit days,
K - number of days in a year - 365 or 366.



## Calculating compound interest

Most often, banks offer programs with monthly capitalization. When choosing conditions for a deposit, remember the general pattern: the less often interest is added to the body of the deposit, the lower the income.

### Daily capitalization

The following formula will help calculate the income for each day of the deposit:

where
Dv is the amount at the end of the term, including the opening amount and accrued interest,
P is the initial deposit amount,
N is the annual interest rate divided by 100,
K is the number of days in a year - 365 or 366,
T is the investment period in days.

### Monthly capitalization

When the bank summarizes the income on the deposit once a month, the calculation is carried out according to the formula:

where:
Дв — final income, that is, the amount of the deposit at the end of the term, including the opening amount and accrued interest,
P — the initial deposit,
N — the annual rate divided by 100,
T — the term of the contract in months.
